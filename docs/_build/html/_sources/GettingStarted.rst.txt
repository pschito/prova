The first step is to get a username on our database and a password to enter our HPC clusters.

The second step is to have some knowledge of Linux OS. If you need some information on how to work in a Linux environment you may check the `Ubuntu Help <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal>`_ or a `UNIX Tutorial <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/index.html>`_.

Please contact the CFDHub contact person of your research group to register to CFDHub. The contact person will give you the instructions to get a CFDHub access.
In the table below you find the list of groups of CFDHub, you may find your contact person.
